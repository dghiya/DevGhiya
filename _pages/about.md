ü§ñ Robotics Engineer in the making  
üéì Johns Hopkins University - MS Robotics  


üî¨ Research Focus
======

I am interested in Robotics, Controls, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Learning. Most of my work revolves around designing, controlling, and automating robots to make them smarter and more autonomous. 

üíº Experience
======


Dosage rate for mouse for cancer treatment something like that 
------
I am Graduate Research Assistant at Advanced Medical Instrumentation and Robotics (AMIRo) Research Lab. Developing a custom robotics design for mice for FLASH raadiation therpy. We have achenived sub-militer upto 40 microns postion accuracy for argeted X-ray delivery through variable collimator configurations. Also making a modular bed design which can be used in MICRO CT machine for radiotion thterpy too.   where I am making a complete setup for a mice for radiotherpy. bed design, collimator design, micro ct sharing bed, controlling x ray dosage rate with collimators, aethsta nozzle design.

Putting a car steering hanlde using UR5: Probabilitic RoadMap - Motion Planner
------
Implemented custom PRM-based motion planner in C++ for UR5 robotic arm to autonomously grasp and install automotive steering wheels. Built collision-free roadmap with 400 vertices in 6D configuration space, utilizing KD-tree data structure for efficient nearest neighbor queries to connect vertices within 4.0 radian distance threshold. Applied graph theory algorithms including BFS for path search through adjacency list representation, achieving O(V+E) time complexity. Leveraged FLANN library for optimized spatial indexing and integrated with MoveIt framework for collision checking using FCL backend. Achieved sub-30 second planning times for complex assembly tasks, validating approach through successful steering wheel installation in cluttered automotive workspace.

UR5 Robotic Arm Control for Parallel Line Drawing
------
Programmed UR5 robot to perform "place-and-draw" task, teaching start/end positions to draw two 5cm parallel lines with 10cm spacing. Implemented three control algorithms in MATLAB: Inverse Kinematics using DH parameters and Paden-Kahan subproblems (selecting optimal solution from 8 possibilities), Resolved Rate control with discrete-time implementation, and Jacobian Transpose for trajectory tracking. Incorporated manipulability analysis for singularity avoidance and optimized control gains (K) and time steps (Œît) through iterative testing. Achieved rotation-invariant algorithm design allowing parallel line drawing regardless of initial point orientation.

Semantic SLAM Detecting object is 3D map
------
Developed an end-to-end real-time semantic SLAM system by first capturing and manually annotating 1,000+ images of various objects across different colors and orientations to create a robust training dataset. Trained YOLOv7 model achieving 91% mAP@0.5 for accurate object detection across shape and color variations. Performed camera calibration using OpenCV checkerboard method to extract intrinsic parameters and distortion coefficients from Pi Camera v2. Developed Python streaming utilities to capture raw image data from Raspberry Pi 4 and convert to ROS bag format for consistent input processing. Integrated the trained YOLOv7 model with ORB-SLAM3 through multi-threaded ROS Noetic pipeline, where SLAM generates sparse 3D point clouds while YOLO performs real-time object detection at 30 FPS. Implemented direct semantic fusion by projecting 2D bounding box detections onto 3D map points using calibrated depth measurements, creating a dense semantic map with real-time object labeling and spatial localization.

Morphing robot
------
Conceptualized and designed a novel bio-inspired morphing robot system through comprehensive biomimetic research to identify 8 distinct operational configurations for versatile terrain adaptation. Developed detailed mechanical design integrating dual locomotion systems: mecanum wheels for omnidirectional ground movement and quadcopter propellers for aerial capabilities, enabling hybrid air-ground movement schemes. Created 3D CAD models and engineering drawings specifying actuator placement, joint mechanisms, and transformation sequences between configurations. Implemented basic Arduino control code for manual switching between ground-based car configuration and aerial drone configuration through servo motor actuation. Validated design feasibility through kinematic analysis and structural simulations of the morphing mechanisms.

Developed a novel needle manipulation system featuring an aperture-inspired gripper with compliant flexure design achieving 0.1mm accuracy. Implemented three micro high-torque geared motors controlling needle insertion, rotation, and flexure-actuated gripping mechanism that moves concentrically like a camera aperture. Engineered PLA-based compliant mechanics enabling dynamic inner diameter adjustment while maintaining safe gripping forces, resulting in 24% weight reduction from previous design. Built Raspberry Pi-based control system operating at 100Hz with PID controllers for real-time motor control. Successfully demonstrated proof-of-concept for precision needle manipulation combining aperture-style gripping with compliant robotics principles for medical applications.
